                <p class="lead">Welcome to the MDN learning area. This set of articles aims to guide complete beginners to web development with all that they need to start coding websites. The aim of this area of MDN is not to take you from "beginner" to "expert" but
                    to take you from "beginner" to "comfortable." From there, you should be able to start making your way, learning from the rest of MDN, and other intermediate to advanced resources that assume a lot of previous knowledge. If you are
                    a complete beginner, web development can be challenging — we will hold your hand and provide enough detail for you to feel comfortable and learn the topics properly. You should feel at home whether you are a student learning web development
                    (on your own or as part of a class), a teacher looking for class materials, a hobbyist, or someone who just wants to understand more about how web technologies work.</p>

                <p class="lead">Django is an extremely popular and fully featured server-side web framework, written in Python. This module shows you why Django is one of the most popular web server frameworks, how to set up a development environment, and how to start
                    using it to create your own web applications. Prerequisites Before starting this module you don't need to have any knowledge of Django. Ideally, you would need to understand what server-side web programming and web frameworks are by
                    reading the topics in our Server-side website programming first steps module. A general knowledge of programming concepts and Python is recommended, but is not essential to understanding the core concepts.</p>

                <p class="lead">At its heart, HTML is a fairly simple language made up of elements, which can be applied to pieces of text to give them different meaning in a document (Is it a paragraph? Is it a bulleted list? Is it part of a table?), structure a document
                    into logical sections (Does it have a header? Three columns of content? A navigation menu?), and embed content such as images and videos into a page. This module will introduce the first two of these and introduce fundamental concepts
                    and syntax you need to know to understand HTML. Looking to become a front-end web developer? We have put together a course that includes all the essential information you need to work towards your goal. Get started Prerequisites Before
                    starting this module, you don't need any previous HTML knowledge, but you should have at least basic familiarity with using computers and using the web passively (i.e., just looking at it and consuming content). You should have a basic
                    work environment set up (as detailed in Installing basic software), and understand how to create and manage files (as detailed in Dealing with files). Both are parts of our Getting started with the web complete beginner's module.</p>
